	<h1>Story in the Book</h1>
	
	<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

	<p>
		Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientists</i>, and all the other scientific journals her worked had appered in, a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college and the longer she spend between these four walls the more she fell she needed to be free.</p>
	<p>
		She had spend the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar 
		Wilde quote procaliming that <q>Work is the refugee of the people that have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work unravellling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
